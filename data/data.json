{"title": "OPPO F11 Pro (Thunder Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with Offer", "brand": "Oppo", "rating": "4.3 out of 5 stars", "price": "23,780.00", "colour": "Thunder Black", "instock": true, "reviews": ["First of all thanks to OPPO for making this wonderful device. The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.", "Pros:", "1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.", "2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.", "3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.", "4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.", "5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.", "6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly", "7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.", "8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.", "9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well", "10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.", "Cons:", "1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.", "2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.", "Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.", "I love this phone thank you amazon and Oppo team for F11 pro.", "I have one issue with phone :", "My phone is getting heated while calling (for more than 15-20 min. talk) please suggest me and if any one facing this same issue so please reply...", "Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.", "Pros", "- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...", "- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.", "- iPhone type headset.", "- Full view display", "- Andriod pie features", "No cons till now..", "Good mobile very nice thank you oppo", "I am Full happy dis moble camera v v v good super  super", "I didnt got free bluetooth speaker and selfie stick what is this", "Very Nice Phone.

Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones.

Poco F1, Honor play, Zenfone 5z and OnePlus 6. These are my shortlists and I first removed op6 because I personally didn't like oneplus because of its overrated specs and camera. SD845 is capable of AI but there is no single feature (thati know of) that used AI in oxygen OS. Then I started reading the official forums of these 3 phones. In Zenfone 5z forums, there are so many people complaining of its bugs and slow updates fixing those bugs. So I removed it next. Then I started thinking extensively on what to buy in between poco F1 and Honor play.", "I started reading Honor play forums first. In all reviews there, I see people are very satisfied with this and there are very very few complaints in the forumsR (may be a in 20). But I am inclined towards towards sd845 of poco. So, I started reading it's forums and there, I have observed so many people complaining of its build quality and display. I am still convinced some how to compromise on these two. And thought of buying it only because of sd845. I kept on reading the forums day to day. And the complaints in the poco forums kept on increasing related to its display. I have seen one complaint related to screen bleeding in poco for which the company said it is a software issue. I didn't understand how far it is true. What I wanted is not give discouraged after investing 20K of my money. So finally I took the call and ordered HONOR PLAY. I believed in the public forums but not YouTube reviews. The forums will never give wrong data as far as I believe.", "5 star for the delivery. I got the order delivered on the very next day. Thanks to Amazon. Now coming to mobile,", "Believe me guys, this is a beast. U will never feel bad for investing ur hard earned 18k on this phone.", "1) the build quality is excellent. It feels very premium in hand.", "2) camera is awesome. The pics that I take from this phone really comes very very gud. U can follow me at @praveen_buddhavarapu in Instagram to see some samples of this camera. U won't believe me if I say the night mode is also very Gud. The entire YouTube has completely gone angry with the nightmode of this phone. But believe me guys this phone's camera is no where less to any flagship camera even in night mode.", "3) the gallery app. This is the most lovely thing in this phone. I have been wondering how apple used face recognition and sorts photos based on faces, places and things. The same is also being done by Honor in this phone. The gallery app sorts and orders the pics based on the location, faces, things. And the next best thing is, it creates videos of the people like how apple does in iOS gallery app.", "4) Histen audio feature. If u wear earphones and listen to some FLAC songs with full volume with the Histen sound mode set to auto, trust me u will feel very much involved in the song and u can definitely forget about the sorroundings (use it at high volume only in ur personal place, but please keep track of us sorroundings in public places)", "4) Display is awesome. I have used a mobile with amoled display previously and I use to feel very indulged when I watch HD videos in it. The fhd display in Honor play is no where inferior to the amoled display and u can find no difference at all in between the two displays.", "5) the massive 3750 mah battery is a great thing in this phone. I don't use dual sim though my previous phones have dual sim support. I always use only one Airtel sim. With single sim, the battery use to stand for 1 and half day completely with normal usage. Always internet was on and screen on time is around 2-3hrs in an average.", "6) EMUI is perfectly blended. No bugs umi identified in my personal usage except one personal suggestion. That is they have to implement the iPhone X kind of gestures as soon as possible in this. Because when we type something, the on screen home button comes exactly down the space button and in speed typing, I sometimes use to hit on the home button instead of space. So this is the only problem is faced in this. Though Honor has confirmed the iPhone X style of gestures in Pie update, I am eagerly waiting for it.", "7) the notification led is placed at the correct position inside the earpiece. I think all the phones should place the led inside the earpiece as it won't take any extra place there. I tested it with blue, white, orange, green  olkurs. But I think it will glow in some other colours as well.", "8) lastly the performance, man this is a beast. I can't say anything more. I have been using this for past one month and I never faced single hiccup with this phone. like the phone was branded, it is very smooth a gaming. I play pubg atleast 3-4 full games per day (mean 1-2 hrs daily) and I never faced any issue like lag or frame drop with this phone. The gaming suite is awesome. It won't show the annoying notifications as notification heads when we are playing any games.", "Finally I can say that this is a phone worth its price and worth my time I spent looking at reviews for this. I first feared that, after buying this phone, i might get a feeling that I didn't buy poco or Zenfone. But I never got such a feelong while using this. I am very much satisfied with this mobile and i'm happy that I didn't buy POCO. I don't know how many issues that I would face if I had bought poco.", "Hope this review helps u to decide on ur phone. Please let me know if u have any questions related to this phone. I am happy to answer.", "I purchased the mobile on last week of October. Everything was fine. The performance was outstanding. The build quality was super, but yesterday my phone explode. Now I know how they implement flagship processor at such a low price tag. I don't think that they use a good quality battery.", "Thankfully I didn't get injuries.", "I don't recomend this phone to buy. Please guys stay away from this phone . Please don't buy this. And those who already purchased this please use this device carefully.", "Finally after one month i am writing my experience about honor play 6 GB varient. it is a good phone with good visual display. i was very confused before buying this product because of so called mobile experts on youtube some youtubers claim that camera is just OK and struggle in low light and BLA BLA but finally i bought this on my own risk and i am happy to buy it.", "1) Camera quality is good and it takes very sharp pictures but those who are expecting DSLR quality please don't buy it", "  because it is a phone which contains camera feature, if you are fond of photography then please buy a DSLR and", "  don't buy any phone for that.", "  People take selfie/ backshot and zoom it and i don't know why they do so and finally complain some noise and all", "  that stuff.
