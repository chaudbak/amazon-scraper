I have used almost every brand the last 4 or 5 years but at Last I feel myself \"I'm back to my home after a very long journey\". Best built quality, best camera(but use gcam), very nice design, perfect size, nice display, very good performance. Snapdragon 636 from nokia is far faster n better in all respect than a Snapdragon 660AIE processor of Xiaomi mi \u00e02 or Redmi note 7s or 7. I use both these phones and I'm talking exactly what I experience practically in real life. Moreover the 48mp camera from redmi note 7pro is incomparable with Nokia's 16mp while using Gcam. Even older Nokia 6.1(non plus model) beats the camera of note 7 pro both front and rear. I suggest don't even hope to bring note7 pro's gimmick 48mp near nokia 6.1plus. Everything is perfect with this phone. But the battery life will be a deal breaker for many of the our youths as they will charge twice a day(PUBG!!!!). That's why I'm reducing one \ud83c\udf1f. But for me it's quite easy to manage for one day usage as I previously use iPhone 7. I don't know why many costumers  in amazon are ruining this very good phone. They have made change many people's minds so that they(many people) left this Nokia 6.1plus from the best seller (Apario) of amazon for an alternative phone. I suggest this phone to everyone. Don't go wrong, don't trust these ill reviews and comments.
